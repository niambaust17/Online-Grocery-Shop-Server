# Online Grocery Shop

[Live Site](https://online-grocery-shop-3f14f.web.app)

This is a beginner-level full-stack web-based project. Here we use firebase authentication to authenticate users. On this website, authenticated users can add products, remove products, order products, and also see all products that they ordered previously.

Here we use MongoDB, Express, React, Nodejs, Firebase authentication, Bootstrap, Font Awesome, and javascript ES6 features.
